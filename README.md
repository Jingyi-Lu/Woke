## Project Overview

### Project Scope

This project aims to build a mobile application, in order to provide people an efficient and convenient way to know about charities and choose to donate to them. Apart from that, this project provides charity organisations a platform to post promotional materials for their current activities.  
  
In detail, charity organizations can register for an account, and after verified, they can write posts with tags and categories. They can label themselves to tell others what type of charity they are. Also, organizations may tell people how much donations they need for each activity. Ordinary people can also register accounts without verification. When they sign up for an account, they can choose their interest. They are able to explore activities related to their interest or popular posts in this application. Then, they can donate money to their preferred organisations. Besides, this application allows users to message and mention other users. 

### Project Objectives & Impacts

This project is aimed to:
- enhance the common people's engagement with charity organisations  
- increase donations to charities and thus charities can do more activities and change the world to a better one
- widespread the knowledge of charity among the people

### Client's Vision

Creating a platform that allows charity organisation to post the promotional material of the aid projects that they are working on. And common people can view the posts and donate money to charity on that platform.

### Client's Expectation

Our client is a non-technical person, and she has no specified expectation. However, she gives a description of the minimum product which involves a platform which can be used to view & post material of charity organisation using mobile phone.

### Risks and Technical Constraints:
- Time and Workload Management  
Woke is a completely blank project without any modules completed before, thus, our team will make it from idea. Our team members are all persons without work experience, so we will take time to be familiar with the practical development and discover problems which are not considered overhead.  
- External API and Security  
As Woke is used to provide an efficient way to donate to charity, API about payment must be included and usersâ€™ security should be confirmed.
- Database Maintenance and Optimization  
We are using relational database, but it may not work well in some situations. 
- Test  
Lack of test environment. Our application need to be runned on cell phone and web server, but we can only test it on our local machine.
